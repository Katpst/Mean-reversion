# Mean Reversion Strategy
This is a simple trading strategy project where I test if stock (or ETF) prices tend to return to their average over time.

## What the strategy does:
- Buys when the price drops below its recent average
- Sells when the price goes above the average
- Closes the trade when the price crosses back

## Tools I'm using:
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- yfinance 

## Status:
Work in progress.
